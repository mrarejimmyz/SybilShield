## Component Descriptions

### 1. On-Chain Components
The on-chain components are implemented as Move modules deployed on the Aptos blockchain. These modules handle:
- Transaction pattern analysis
- Address clustering
- Temporal analysis
- Gas usage pattern detection
- On-chain reputation scoring
- Integration with Aptos Indexer

### 2. Off-Chain Components
The off-chain components run as services that interact with the blockchain and provide advanced analytics:
- Machine learning models for Sybil detection
- Feature extraction from blockchain data
- Social media verification services
- Decentralized identity integration
- Proof of personhood verification
- Off-chain reputation scoring

### 3. Developer API & SDK
The API and SDK provide interfaces for developers to integrate AptosSybilShield into their applications:
- RESTful API endpoints
- Client libraries for multiple languages
- Webhook notification system
- Risk scoring configuration
- Documentation and examples

### 4. Dashboard
The dashboard provides a visual interface for monitoring and analytics:
- Real-time Sybil detection monitoring
- Historical data analysis
- Configuration management
- User management
- Reporting and exports

### 5. Privacy Layer
The privacy layer ensures that user data is protected while still enabling effective Sybil detection:
- Zero-knowledge proof implementation
- Differential privacy mechanisms
- Secure data storage
- Privacy-preserving analytics

## Data Flow

1. **On-Chain Data Collection**:
   - Transaction data is collected from the Aptos blockchain
   - Move modules analyze patterns and store results
   - Indexer API provides historical data access

2. **Off-Chain Analysis**:
   - ML models process on-chain data
   - Identity verification services validate user identities
   - Combined analysis produces Sybil risk scores

3. **Developer Integration**:
   - Applications query the API for risk scores
   - Webhooks notify applications of suspicious activity
   - Dashboard provides monitoring and configuration

4. **Privacy Protection**:
   - Zero-knowledge proofs verify identity without revealing personal data
   - Differential privacy techniques protect user information
   - Decentralized storage secures sensitive data

## Technical Interfaces
